            <p><h1>Now we are going to explore about acid-base indicators</h1></p>
            <p>First of all what are<b> acid-base indicators?</b></p>
            <p>Acid-base indicators are indicators thet indicade whether it is an acid or a base.</p>
            <p>Most common acid base indicators are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>universal indicator (also in liquidic form and paper form, made out of different colours)</li>
                <li>litmus (in liquid form and paper form also,extracted from a plants known as lichen)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>litmus paper indicates whether it is acid base only.</p>
            <p>universal indicator indicates whether it is acid or base but also how strong it really it using the<b> pH scale</b></p>
            <p>pH scale is the scale which shows how much acidic or <i>alkaline</i> it is(alkaline is base that dissolves in water)</p>
            <img src="images/phscale.jpg"alt="this is the pH scale"title="the pH scale shows how acidic or alkaline it is"/>
            <p>there are also some other kind of indicators that are used in the factory but have their own pH scale for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>phenophthalein</li>
                <li>methyl orange</li>
                <li>bromocresol green</li>
            </ul>
